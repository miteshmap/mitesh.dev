## Hi there,

My name is Mitesh and I'm a full-stack developer.

I am based in Surat, Gujarat, India. I work at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/).

I graduated in 2010 with Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Information technology from Saurashtra University, Rajkot. I developed my interest of coding during my school days, where I learnt logo, pascal, HTML, css. During my engineering, I learnt C / C++ / JAVA and after graduation I started learning PHP and later I got job as a PHP developer, since then I am working as a web developer, I have worked with various CMS like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla.

While not working, I like to spend time with my family. I enjoy watching movies, swimming, internet games and reading blogs.
