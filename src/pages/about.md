## Hi There,

My name is Mitesh Patel. I work at [Dept](https://www.deptagency.com/).

I'm a full stack web developer and passionate about web technologies.

I developed my interest of coding during my school days, where I learnt logo, pascal, HTML, CSS. During my Graduation, I learnt C, C++, JAVA and after graduation I started working as PHP developer while learning php, And for the last 10 years I have worked with various CMS like Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal.

While on the frontend I have worked on multiple parts, where at one time I used develop a html and css from psds And from that to Drupal / wordpress theme development.

Currently I work mostly with Javascript technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS.
