## Hi There,

![miteshmap](../images/miteshmap.jpeg)

My name is Mitesh Patel. I work at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/).

I'm a full stack web developer who is passionate about various web technologies. I like to experiment with different web technologies.

I developed my interest of coding during my school days, where I learnt logo, pascal, HTML, CSS.
During Engineering, I learnt C, C++, JAVA and after graduation I started working as PHP developer while learning php, And for the last 10 years I have worked with various CMS like Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla.

While on the frontend I have worked on multiple parts, where at one time I used develop a html and css from psds And from that to Drupal / wordpress theme development.

Currently I work mostly with Javascript technologies like ReactJS, VueJs (NuxtJs), NodeJS. I'm always a learner and a self taught programmer.

While not working, I like to spend time with my family. I enjoy watching movies, swimming, internet games and reading blogs.
