The script is created purely based the video I saw on youtube about Personal finance on how to save money with small savings.

If you invest 2 INR a day,In a year you can save around 133590 INR.

The calculation goes like: if on the,
1st of january you save 2 rupees
2nd january you have to save 2*2 = 4 and 3 day 2*3 = 6 and likewise.

You can not ideally transac this small amount to the bank, so I created this script to calculate monthly savings, so you can put that amount aside for any given month.
